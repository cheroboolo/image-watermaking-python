###Usage

This script allows you to add a watermark or logo to images in a specified folder.

    * First you need to add image on Add button.
    * After you added image, it returns size of image with x and y cordinates for easier positioning text or logo.
    * You have to choose to add text or image, before add any of that, you need to fill some empty fields.
    * For text you need to add text, x and y cordinaters where you want to place text(place text depends on size of 
        image) and font size. After all fields are fill, then press Add Text and you have Watermarked image.
    * Logo and text are connected with first image add. After you do the step 1, next is to add the logo. Before
        press button Add Logo, fill the fields of x and y cordinates, where you want to place logo. When you press
        Add Logo, you need to choose logo from your device and you have saved your image and example on top of your 
        screen.


###Ideas for future improvements

    * text style(modern text styles, not Arial)
    * adjust watermarks to be semi-transparent
    * multiple watermarks on random positioning
    * more messages to interact with user and error prompts what user must corects and what inputs are not correct.
